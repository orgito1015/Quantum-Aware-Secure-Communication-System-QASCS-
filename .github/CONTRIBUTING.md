## 🔧 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Virtual environment tool (venv)

### Setting Up Your Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/orgito1015/Quantum-Aware-Secure-Communication-System-QASCS-.git
cd Quantum-Aware-Secure-Communication-System-QASCS-

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package in editable mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Or use the Makefile
make install
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=qasccs --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_quantum_risk_engine.py
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code with black
black qasccs tests

# Check types with mypy
mypy qasccs

# Lint with pylint
pylint qasccs
```

## 📝 Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Use type hints for all function signatures

### Code Organization

```python
# Good: Clear, documented function with type hints
def assess_quantum_risk(
    data_lifetime_years: int,
    data_classification: str,
    current_year: int = 2026
) -> dict:
    """
    Assess quantum computing risk for given parameters.
    
    Args:
        data_lifetime_years: How long the data must remain secure
        data_classification: Data sensitivity level (low/medium/high)
        current_year: Current year for risk calculation
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing risk assessment and recommendations
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Documentation

- All public modules, classes, and functions must have docstrings
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include examples in docstrings for complex functions
- Keep README and docs up to date with code changes

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain >80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names: `test_quantum_risk_engine_high_risk_scenario`
- Include both positive and negative test cases

## 🔀 Pull Request Process

### Before Creating a Pull Request

1. **Create an issue first** - Discuss your changes before implementing them
2. **Fork the repository** - Work in your own fork
3. **Create a branch** - Use a descriptive branch name
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-kyber-support
   git checkout -b fix/server-connection-timeout
   ```
4. **Make your changes** - Follow coding standards
5. **Write tests** - Ensure your changes are tested
6. **Update documentation** - Document new features
7. **Run tests** - Make sure all tests pass
8. **Commit your changes** - Use clear commit messages

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): brief description

Longer description if needed.

Fixes #123
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting)
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(quantum-risk): add support for Kyber-1024

Implements Kyber-1024 algorithm support in the quantum risk engine
for enhanced post-quantum security.

Fixes #42
```

```
fix(server): resolve connection timeout issue
